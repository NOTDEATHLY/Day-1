 <h1>Date: February 7, 2026 Current Status: Day 1 at Codingal</h1>
 <p>"Today is the official start of my journey.<br> I’m moving from being a gamer to a creator. It feels a bit like learning a
secret language that only computers understand.<br> I’m starting with the basics of logic—learning how to think like a
machine.<br> It’s not just about typing; it’s about solving puzzles.<br> I'm ready to earn that 'Coding Prodigy' badge!"</p>
